        "> (1) I don't know how carmelizing works, either.  Google tells me that it involves the non-enzymatic breakdown of sugar and the removal of water (which seems to contradict the question).  I think there's an interaction here since (I imagine, heat will not carmelize an onion if it's submerged in a pot of boiling water--so the effect of heat depends on moisture.  $$C = \\beta_H H + \\beta_M M + \\beta_{HM} H M$$.  I don't have an intercept here because I imagine that no heat will produce no carmelizing.\n",
        "\n",
        "> (2) I'm going to imagine that this could be an interactive effect: a car with more cylinders will perform better-than-linearly with more better fuel injectors.  In this case, $$S = \\beta_C C + \\beta_F F + \\beta_{CF} C F$$.  But I could also imagine that any ole fuel injector will do the trick as long as it works, in which case, this is additive like $$S = \\beta_C C + \\beta_F F$$. Again, I don't have an intercept because a car with no cylinders probably won't go very fast...\n",
        "\n",
        "> (3) This one is tricky.  It's describing an either-or situation.  Either a person gets their political beliefs from their parents or from their friends.  But this is NOT an interaction, as we've learned so far, since the effect of parents does not depend on the effect of friends.  We will later learn that the one's political beliefs may not be a linear function, and that this will cause interaction between parents and friends...just not interaction in the way we've learned so far.  So I'm going to say a linear model is like $$P = \\alpha + \\beta_I I$$, where $I$ is an indicator variable representing the source of influence (parents or friends).\n",
        "\n",
        "> (4) No interaction here: the effect of sociality is not be described as being modulated by the effect of appendages (and vice versa).  $$I = \\alpha + \\beta_S S + \\beta_A A$$"

        "In parts of North America, ravens depend upon wolves for their food. This is because ravens are carnivorous but cannot usually kill or open carcasses of prey. Wolves however can and do kill and tear open animals, and they tolerate ravens co-feeding at their kills.
